# Problem statment 
Mental health and well-being are important factors in the overall success and happiness of students, yet many schools struggle to effectively measure and support the emotional well-being of their students. 

There is a need for a tool that can help schools track and improve the happiness of their students in order to create a more positive school culture and support the overall well-being of the student body.

# Solution
We have to develop an application that calculates the Happiness Index of students and ranks schools accordingly. The application also provides suggestions to overcome the weaknesses in the school structure. The rankings would allow new parents to select schools that are suitable for their children and also motivate the schools to do better and improve their ranks

## Features
- School Ranking and happiness index
- Feed for tracking schools activities 
- Daily Mood tracing of students
- Personalized Suggestion to improve thier happiness index
- Dynamic Weights

## Challenges we ran into

 happiness is a complex and subjective concept, and our algorithm has two weights

1.  Daily Mood Tracking Weights
2.  Weekly questionnaire for happiness survey Weights

-   a questionnaire may not capture all factors that influence a student's happiness.
-   also, we add mood manually that's why some time happiness score is not up to the mark.
